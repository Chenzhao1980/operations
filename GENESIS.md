## Genesis

The genesis block of vUnits is more than complex than other genesis blocks because it has to initialize all the trusted parties. Without an identity key the miners can't generate addresses for their rewards. The Value Units Foundation (VUF) is working with the DIGEX to coordinate the first block and setup the network of miners.
